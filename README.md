# Factor-based portfolio diversification across asset classes

This repository contains scripts that were used to conduct experiments within my the bachelor's thesis. The research aims to find out whether a traditional factor-based portfolio formed on equity can be improved by introducing factors of other asset classes, such as currency and cryptocurrency. The scripts presented in this repository were created to adress the following tasks:
* To evaluate and compare individual performance of a stock portfolio, traditional currency portfolio and cryptocurrency portfolio.
* To assess and compare the results of combining different asset classes in one long-short portfolio.
* To determine which long-short portfolio optimisation strategy works best for different types of asset classes and their possible combinations.

In addition to the scripts, we also provide files containing data on the returns of the constructed portfolios as well as the factor weights.

Considering that GitHub does not offer a preview of .mlx files, we provide scripts in both .m and .mlx formats. However, we recommend using .mlx scripts, because they offer a better representation of comments and explanatory notes to the code.
